## Features

- Automatically detects the user's geolocation (latitude and longitude).  
- Fetches and displays current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, weather description, and more.  
- Minimalistic, intuitive UI—built for quick and effortless use.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** & **CSS** – Basic structure and styling.
